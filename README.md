# Hands-on Robotics
Hands-on Robotics is a graduate course provided to Ph.D. students in Biorobotics at Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna.

## Abstract
Hands-on Robotics is an immersive and hands-on course designed for 1st-2nd year Ph.D. students with a theoretical background in engineering who seek to bridge the gap between theory and practice in the exciting field of Biorobotics. Over the duration of the course, participants will embark on a journey to design a robotic application from scratch, delving into essential aspects of the process. From the initial phase of understanding and defining functional and non-functional requirements to practice using Autodesk Fusion 360 for CAD and ECAD, real-time programming with Arduino-like boards, communication protocols, sensing strategies, GUI design with Python, and data processing with tools like Matlab and Jupyter Notebook, the course equips students with the practical skills needed to bring theoretical concepts to life. A project-based approach will allow participants to directly apply their knowledge to create a functional prototype, gaining invaluable experience useful for their Ph.D.
